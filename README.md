# Double Successive Over-Relaxation Q-Learning with an Extension to Deep Reinforcement Learning

This repository contains codes related to my paper on Double Successive Over-Relaxation Q-Learning with an extension to Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). The project is organized into two main folders: one for the tabular version of Double SOR Q-Learning and one for the Deep RL version.

## Project Structure

### Tabular Version

The `Tabular_Version` folder contains Python code to run environments and experiments for:

- **Roulette Environment**
- **Grid World Environment**

This folder also includes the necessary files for plotting results and analyzing performance.

### Deep RL Version

The `Deep_RL_Version` folder includes code for running:

- **CartPole Environment**
- **Lunar Lander Environment**
- **Maximization Example**

These implementations leverage deep reinforcement learning techniques to explore the effectiveness of Double SOR Q-Learning in more complex scenarios.
